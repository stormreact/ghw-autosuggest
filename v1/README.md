See the gridlist directory...

This is the final version of code with
[react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest)
that has a drop down of locations with data below it inside a
[Material-ui table](https://material-ui.com/demos/tables/#tables)

This code will be migrated along with
[mui-cardfile](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-card-file)
over to a new repo with combined functionality.

This demo is based on:
[react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest),
[autosuggest-highlight](https://github.com/moroshko/autosuggest-highlight)

For more details go
[here to the material-ui demo page](https://material-ui-next.com/demos/autocomplete/)

Put this debugging code inside your **render** method
to display the size of the arry.

```
<Typography type="subheading" gutterBottom>
  hitsug array length is {hitsug.length}
</Typography>
```
